# Task List 
1.	You are given an 18-month transactional data set. Please split this data set into two 9-month periods.

2.	Create churn variable from dataset. You are supposed to use the first 9-month duration to construct your model. For example, you should use the first 6-month duration for the active users and use the last 3-month period to determine if these active users churn within this 3-month period. (Please resolve if there is imbalance in response before modeling.)

3.	Once you learn from the first 9-month period, proceed with the second 9-month data. Use your churn model obtained in (2) to predict if active customers (for example, those who were active in the first 6-month period of the second data set) churn in the last 3 months of this duration.
